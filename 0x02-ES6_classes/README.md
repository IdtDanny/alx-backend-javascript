Your code will be tested using Jest and the command npm run test
Your code will be verified against lint using ESLint
Your code needs to pass all the tests and lint. You can verify the entire project running npm run full-test

Tasks
-----
0. You used to attend a place like this at some point
#mandatory
Implement a class named ClassRoom:

Prototype: export default class ClassRoom
It should accept one attribute named maxStudentsSize (Number) and assigned to _maxStudentsSize
bob@dylan:~$ cat 0-main.js
import ClassRoom from "./0-classroom.js";

const room = new ClassRoom(10);
console.log(room._maxStudentsSize)

bob@dylan:~$ 
bob@dylan:~$ npm run dev 0-main.js 
10
bob@dylan:~$ 

1. Let's make some classrooms
#mandatory
Import the ClassRoom class from 0-classroom.js.

Implement a function named initializeRooms. It should return an array of 3 ClassRoom objects with the sizes 19, 20, and 34 (in this order).

bob@dylan:~$ cat 1-main.js
import initializeRooms from './1-make_classrooms.js';

console.log(initializeRooms());

bob@dylan:~$ 
bob@dylan:~$ npm run dev 1-main.js 
[
  ClassRoom { _maxStudentsSize: 19 },
  ClassRoom { _maxStudentsSize: 20 },
  ClassRoom { _maxStudentsSize: 34 }
]
bob@dylan:~$ 

2. A Course, Getters, and Setters
#mandatory
Implement a class named HolbertonCourse:

Constructor attributes:
name (String)
length (Number)
students (array of Strings)
Make sure to verify the type of attributes during object creation
Each attribute must be stored in an “underscore” attribute version (ex: name is stored in _name)
Implement a getter and setter for each attribute.
bob@dylan:~$ cat 2-main.js
import HolbertonCourse from "./2-hbtn_course.js";

const c1 = new HolbertonCourse("ES6", 1, ["Bob", "Jane"])
console.log(c1.name);
c1.name = "Python 101";
console.log(c1);

try {
    c1.name = 12;
} 
catch(err) {
    console.log(err);
}

try {
    const c2 = new HolbertonCourse("ES6", "1", ["Bob", "Jane"]);
}
catch(err) {
    console.log(err);
}

bob@dylan:~$ 
bob@dylan:~$ npm run dev 2-main.js 
ES6
HolbertonCourse {
  _name: 'Python 101',
  _length: 1,
  _students: [ 'Bob', 'Jane' ]
}
TypeError: Name must be a string
    ...
TypeError: Length must be a number
    ...
bob@dylan:~$ 

4. Pricing
#mandatory
Import the class Currency from 3-currency.js

Implement a class named Pricing:

Constructor attributes:
amount (Number)
currency (Currency)
Each attribute must be stored in an “underscore” attribute version (ex: name is stored in _name)
Implement a getter and setter for each attribute.
Implement a method named displayFullPrice that returns the attributes in the following format amount currency_name (currency_code).
Implement a static method named convertPrice. It should accept two arguments: amount (Number), conversionRate (Number). The function should return the amount multiplied by the conversion rate.
bob@dylan:~$ cat 4-main.js
import Pricing from './4-pricing.js';
import Currency from './3-currency.js';

const p = new Pricing(100, new Currency("EUR", "Euro"))
console.log(p);
console.log(p.displayFullPrice());

bob@dylan:~$ 
bob@dylan:~$ npm run dev 4-main.js 
Pricing {
  _amount: 100,
  _currency: Currency { _code: 'EUR', _name: 'Euro' }
}
100 Euro (EUR)
bob@dylan:~$
